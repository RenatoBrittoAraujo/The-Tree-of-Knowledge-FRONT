# The Tree of Knowledge

The Tree of Knowledge is a website for searching and contributing to a giant tree forest containing all topics of study one can imagine. From a very extensive topic like mathematics, for example, you may click and click and find yourself in a very specific subtopic of maths you wanted to learn more about. You will find useful recomendations of books, or papers, or links so you can learn that topic. If you know about something and see something is missing from the tree, you can add it to the tree or provide study recommendations about it.
